:: What?? The year of the Cat?? 🙀 {"position":"550,100","size":"100,100"}
Yes! Indeed, the year of Cat exist. There is a slight difference between both animal zodiac symbol. While one represents Chinese New Year and the other represents Vietnamese New Year. 

A-ha-ahem, in Chinese culture, the Rabbit is the fourth in the twelve-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. It is a symbol of longevity, peace and prosperity.

Taking place of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac, the Cat is the 4th animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese zodiac and Gurung zodiac. Additionally, in the Malay zodiac, the mousedeer takes the place of the rabbit.

As such, the traits associated with the Rabbit are attributed to the Cat. However, Cats are in conflict with the Rat. Since cats are the natural enemy of rats, Vietnamese farmers believed cats could bring prosperous harvests and good weather, and therefore replaced rabbit with cat in their zodiac signs.

Also, the Rabbit zodiac and Cat zodiac have similar pronounciation sound therefo-Wait a minute! This isn't the time for a History class!!! Let's get moving and roll some spring rolls!!
